# Demand-Forecasting-using-Random-Forest
Demand forecasting for a drug store chain using Random Forest regression : To demonstrate the usage of Random Forest, we have used a drug store sales dataset available online. The dataset contains historical sales from over 1000 stores of a drug store chain. The timeframe of the data is close to three years (Jan 2013 - July 2015). It contains many factors which could possibly affect the sales like store type, presence of promotions, holidays, distance from competitors, etc. Our objective is to perform a regression analysis and predict Sales using the other variables.
